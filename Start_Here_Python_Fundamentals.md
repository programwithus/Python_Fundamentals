# Variable/Object reference

In Python variables work more like tags. When you do an assignment in Python, it tags the value with the variable name.

```
a = 1 <---- Integer
b = 2.5 <----- Float
c = "apple" <----- String
```

# Strings

String is just a text. We can create them simply by enclosing characters in quotes. Python treats single quotes the same as double quotes. 

word = "apple"

We can not combine strings and integers.


```python
a = 7
b = '7'
total = a + b
```

# Tax and Tip Exercise

```
tax_rate = 0.05 #in python we represent 5% as 0.05
tip_rate = 0.18

cost_of_food = 50

tax = cost_of_food * tax_rate
tip = cost_of_food * tip_rate
total = cost_of_food + tax + tip

print(total)
print(round(total,2))
```
